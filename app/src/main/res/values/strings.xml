        The Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar is a fifty-cent piece struck by the
        United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925 as a commemorative coin in honor of the 150th
        anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.
        It was designed by Chester Beach.
        Members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation introduced legislation in 1924 to
        authorize a commemorative half dollar for the anniversary.
        The bill passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Calvin Coolidge.
        Beach had to satisfy committees from both Lexington and Concord, and the Commission of
        Fine Arts passed the design only reluctantly, feeling he had been given poor materials to
        work with. The coins were sold for $1, and were vended at the anniversary celebrations in
        Lexington and in Concord; they were sold at banks across New England. Although just over
        half of the authorized mintage of 300,000 was struck, almost all the coins that were minted
        were sold. Depending on condition, they are catalogued in the hundreds of dollars.
